This library is a Swift implementation of the [Ethereum fork of Blockies](https://github.com/ethereum/blockies) which is intended to be used with iOS, watchOS, tvOS and macOS.

Blockies generates unique images (identicons) for a given seed string. Those can be used to create images representing an Ethereum (or other Cryptocurrency) Wallet address or really anything else.

## Example

To run the example project, run `pod try BlockiesSwift`. Or clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory.
